# wget
# -S = print the headers sent by HTTP servers and responses sent by FTP servers.
# -o = full path to log file
# -O = full path to output file
# -t = number of retries
# -r = reverse
# -k 7 = sort by the 7th column
# -nd = don't create directories
# -m = Turn on options suitable for mirroring. This option turns on recursion 
#    and time-stamping, sets infinite recursion depth and keeps FTP 
#    directory listings. It is currently equivalent to .-r -N -l 
#    inf --no-remove-listing.. 
#-np
#  --no-parent
#    Do not ever ascend to the parent directory when retrieving recur-
#   sively.  This is a useful option, since it guarantees that only the
#   files below a certain hierarchy will be downloaded.

#******** Optional *************
# Do not download any files if local directories do not exist
local_dir_check=true
# Remove any files in local directory that are not in remote directory
